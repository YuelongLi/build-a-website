/**
    Essentially, the float property allows us to take an element, remove it from the normal flow of a page, and position it to the left or right of its parent element. All other elements on the page will then flow around 
    the floated element. An <img> element floated to the side of a few paragraphs of text, for example, will allow the paragraphs to wrap around the image as necessary.
    When the float property is used on multiple elements at the same time, it provides the ability to create a layout by floating elements directly next to or opposite each other, as seen in multiple-column layouts.
    The float property accepts a few values; the two most popular values are left and right, which allow elements to be floated to the left or right of their parent element.

section{
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
}

aside{
    float: right;
    width: calc(100% - 50% - 100px);
}

/**Clearing and Containing Floats
   Clearing floats is accomplished using the clear property, which accepts a few different values: the most commonly used values being left, right, and both.
   The left value will clear left floats, while the right value will clear right floats. The both value, however, will clear both left and right floats and is often the most ideal value.
