<!--Elements: 
    Elements are dexignators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. Some of the more frequently
    used elements include multiple levels of headings <h> and paragraphs <p>.
 -->
<h1>a heading</h1>

<!--Tags:
     The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a tag.
-->

<!--Attributes:
    Theses are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common atrributes include the id 
    attribute, which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies element; the src attribute, which specifies
    a source for embeddable content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked source
-->

<a href="http://cloudnest.org">Cloudnest</a>

<!--Setting up the html document structure:
     All HTML documents have a required structure that includes the following declaration and elements:
    <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>.
    
    The document type declaration, or <!DOCTYPE html>, informs web browsers which version of HTML is being used and is placed at
    the very beginning of the HTML document. Because we'll being using the lates version of HTML, our docmuent type declaration is 
    simply <!DOCTYPE html>. Following the document type dclaration, the <html> element signifies the beginning of the document.

    Inside the <html> element, the <head> element identifies the top of the document, including any metadata (accompanying information
    about the page). The content inside the <head> element is not displayed on the web page itself. Instead, it may include the document
    title (which is displayed on the title bar in the browser window). links to any external files, or any other beneficial metadata.-->

<!--All of the visible content within the web page will fall within the <body> element. A breakdown of a typical HtML document structure 
    look like this-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a web page.</p>
</body>

</html>

<!--In the previous example, <meta> is a self closing tag.
    Other common selfclosing elements include:-->
<br>, <embed>, <hr>
<img>, <input>, <link>
<meta>, <param>, <source>
<wbr>

<!--Referencing CSS
    In order to get our CSS talking to our HTML, we need to reference our CSS file within our HTML. The best practice for referencing 
    our CSS is to include all of our styles in a single external style sheet, which is referenced from within the <head> element of our
    HTML document. Using a single external style sheet allows us to use the same styles across an entire website and quickly make changes
    sitewide.-->

<!--Other options for adding CSS
    Other options for referencing CSS include using internal and inline styles. You may come across these options in the wild.-->

<p>
    TO create our external CSS style sheet, we'll want to use our text editor of choice again
    to create a new plain text file with a .css file extension. Our CSS file should be saved
    within the same folder, or a subfolder, where our HTML file is located.
</p>  

<p>Within the &lt;head&gt; element of the HTML document, the &lt;link&gt; element is used to
    define the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because we are linking to
    CSS, we use the rel attribute with a value of stylesheet to specify their relationship.
    Futhermore, the href(or hyperlink reference) attribute is used to indentify the location,
    or path, of the CSS file.
</p>

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/main.css">
</head>
<hr>
