        So what exactly are semantics? Semantics within html is the practice of giving content
        on the page meaning and structure by using the proper element. Semantic code
        describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that
        content. Several benefits of using semanticc elements include enabling computers,
        screen readers, search engines, and other devices to adequately read and understand
        the content on a web page.

        <div>
            <!--Divisions, or <div>s, and <span>s are HTML elements that act as containers solely for 
                    styling purposes. As generic containers, they do not come with any overarching meaning
                    or semantic value. Paragraphs are semantic in that content wrapped within a <p> element 
                    is known and understood as a paragraph. <div>s and <span>s do not hold any such meaning 
                    and are simply containers.-->
            A division is a block-level element that is commonly used to identify large groupings of content, and which helps to build
            a wb page's layout and design. A
            <span>span</span>, on the other hand, is an inline-level elements may be nested inside one another; however, they cannot wrap
            block-level elements. We'll usually see inline-level elements with smaller pieces of a content, such as a few words.
