            <h1>Getting to Know CSS</h1>
            
            <p>
                
                CSS allows us to add layout and design to our pages, and it allows us to share those styles from element to element and page to page. Before
                we can unlock all of its features, though, there are a few aspects of the language we must fully understand.<abbr title="astronomic aleviation">
                    aa</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
                First, it's crucial to knwo exactly how styles are rendered. Specifcally, we'll need to know how different types of selectors work and how the
                oreder of those sleectors can afect how our styles are rendered. We'll also want to understand a few common property values that continually 
                appear within CSS, particularly those that deal with color and length.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="the-cascade">
            <h2>The Cascade</h2>
            <p>
                 We’ll begin breaking down exactly how styles are rendered by looking at what is known as the cascade and studying a few
                examples of the cascade in action. Within CSS, all styles cascade from the top of a style sheet to the bottom, allowing different
                styles to be added or overwritten as the style sheet progresses.
            </p>
            <p>
                 For example, say we select all paragraph elements at the top of our style sheet and set their background color to orange
                and their font size to 24 pixels. Then towards the bottom of our style sheet, we select all paragraph elements again and
                set their background color to green, as seen here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the paragraph selector that sets the background color to green comes after
                the paragraph selector that sets the background color to orange, it will take precedene
                in the cascade. All of the paragraphs will appear with a green background. The font size
                will remain 24 pixels because the second paragraph selector didn't identify a new font size.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Cascading Properties</h3>
                <p>
                    The cascaded also works with properties inside individual selectors. Say if we specify the background of an element to green
                    and later declare the background to be orange in the same scope, because the orange background color declaration comes
                    after the green background color declaration, it will overrule the orange background.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="Specificity">
            <h2>Calculating Specificity</h2>
            <p>
                Every selector in CSS has a specificity weight. A selector’s specificity weight, along with its placement in the cascade,
                identifies how its styles will be rendered.
            </p>
            <p>
                The type selector has the lowest specificity weight and holds a point value of 0-0-1. The class selector has a medium specificty 
                weight and holds a point value of 1-0-0. As we can see, specificity poings are calculated using three columns. The first coloumn
                counts id selectors, the second colum class selectors, and the third column type selectors.
            </p>
            <div class="notebox">
                <h3>Specificity Points</h3>
                <p>
                    Specificity points are intentionally hyphenated, as their values are not computed from a base of 10. Class selectors do
                    not hold a point value of 10, and ID selectors do not hold a point value of 100. Instead, these points should be read as
                    0-1-0 and 1-0-0 respectively. We’ll take a closer look at why these point values are hyphenated shortly, when we combine
                    selectors.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    The higher the specificity weight of a selector, the more superiority the selector is given when a styling conflict occurs. 
                    For example if a paragraph element is selectred using a type selector in one place and an ID selector in another, the ID selector
                    will take precedence over the type selector regardless of where the ID selector appears in the cascade.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                 Understanding how the cascade and specificity work is a huge hurdle, and we’ll continue to cover this topic. For now, let’s
                look at how to be a little more particular and intentional with our selectors by combining them. Keep in mind that as we
                combine selectors, we’ll also be changing their specificity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Combining Selectors</h2>
            <p>
                If we want to select an element 'a' that is a child of another element 'b', then the selector in css would be:
                <br>b a{<br>    ...<br>}
            </p>
            <p>
                 When selectors are combined they should be read from right to left. The selector farthest to the right, directly before
                the opening curly bracket, is known as the key selector. The key selector identifies exactly which element the styles will
                be applied to. Any selector to the left of the key selector will serve as a prequalifier.
            </p>

            <p>Let’s take a look at how combining selectors changes a selector’s specificity weight:</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Specificity Within Combined Selectors</h3>
                <p>
                    When selectors are combined, so are the specificity weights of the individual selectors.
                    These combined specificity weighs can be calculated by counting each different type of selector
                    within a combined selector.
                </p>

                <div class="notebox">
                    .hotdog p.mustard { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background: yellow; <br>}
                    <br><br>.hotdog p { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background: brown; <br>}
                </div>

                <p>
                    Looking at our combined selectors from here, the second selector, .hotdog p, had both a class selector and a type selector.
                    Knowing that the point value of a class selector is 0-1-0 and the point value of a type selector is 0-0-1, the total combined
                    point value would be 0-1-1, found by adding up each kind of selector.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first selector, .hotdog p.mustard, had two class selectors and one type selector. Combined, the selector has a point value of 
                    0-2-1. The 0 in the first column is for zero ID selectors, the 2 in the second column is for two class selectors, and the 1 in the
                    the last column if for one type selector.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Comparing the two selectors, the first selector, with its two classes, has a noticeably higher specificity weight and point
                    value. As such it will take precedence within the cascade. If we were to flip the order of these selectors within our style
                    sheet, placing the higher-weighted selector below the lower-weighted selector as shown here, the appearance of their styles
                    would not be affected due to each selector's specificity weight.
                </p>
                <div class="notebox" id="specificity-example">
                    <style>
                       #specificity-example .hotdog p.mustard{
                           background:rgb(202, 206, 2);
                           color:white;
                       } 
                       #specificity-example .hotdog p{

            <div>
                <h3>How is specificity calculated?</h3>
                <p>
                     Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the
                    matching selector. When multiple declarations have equal specificity, the last declaration found in the CSS is applied to
                    the element. Specificity only applies when the same element is targeted by multiple declarations. As per CSS rules, directly
                    targeted elements will always take precedence over rules which an element inherits from its ancestor.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h4>Selector Types</h4>
                     The following list of selector types increases by specificity: 
                    <p>
                        <br>0. Type selectors (e.g., h1) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before).
                        <br>1. Class selectors (e.g., .example), attributes selectors (e.g., [type="radio"]) and pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover).
                        <br>2. ID selectors (e.g., #example).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~, ' ') and negation pseudo-class (:not()) have no effect on specificity. (The
                        selectors declared inside :not() do, however.) Inline styles added to an element (e.g., style="font-weight:bold") always
                        overwrite any styles in external stylesheets, and thus can be thought of as having the highest specificity.
                   </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Layering with multiple classes</h2>
                <p>
                    Elements in HTML can have multiple classes as long as there are separated by spaces. We can add styles to one class of the element
                    and and layer another style through a more specific class. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can tie styles we want to continually reuse to one class and layer on additional styles from another class.
                </p>
                <div class="notebox" id="demo2">
                    <style>
                        .btn {
                            font-size: 16px;
                        }
                        .btn-success {
                            background: green;
                        }
                        .btn-danger {
                            background: red;
                        }
                    </style>
                    <a href="" class="btn-danger btn-success">danger</a>
                    <a href="" class="btn btn-success">success</a>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Through this experiment we find out that the order the class values appear in the "class" atribute doesn't matter.
                    The styles of an element will always be loaded in the sequence of there appearances in the stylesheet. html

            <h2>Common properties in CSS</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Lengths</h3>
                <p>
                     Length values within CSS are similar to colors in that there are a handful of different types of values for length, all
                    of which serve distinct purposes. Length values come in two different forms, absolute and relative, each of which uses different
                    units of measurement.
                </p>
                <h3>Absolute Lengths</h3>
                <p>Absolute length values are the simplest length values, as they are fixed to a physical measurement, such as inches, centimeters,
                or millimeters. The most popular absolute unit of measurement is known as the pixel and is represented by the px unit notation.</p>
                <div>
                    <h4>Pixels</h4>
                    <p>
                         The pixel is equal to 1/96th of an inch; thus there are 96 pixels in an inch. The exact measurement of a pixel, however,
                        may vary slightly between high-density and low-density viewing devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a example: 14px;</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Points(pt)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Points are traditionally used in print media (anything that is to be printed on paper, etc.). One point is equal to 1/72
                        of an inch. Points are much like pixels, in that they are fixed-size units and cannot scale in size.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>Relative Lengths</p>
                <p>
                     In addition to absolute length values, there are also relative length values. Relative length values are a little more complicated,
                    as they are not fixed units of measurement; they rely on the length of another measurement.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h4>Percentages</h4>
                    <p>
                         Percentages, represented by the % unit notation, are one of the most popular relative values. Percentage lengths are defined
                        in relation to the length of another object. For example, to set the width of an element to 50%, we have to know the width
                        of its parent element, the element it is nested within, and then identify 50% of the parent element’s width.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Em</h4>
                    <p>
                         The em unit is also a very popular relative value. The em unit is represented by the em unit notation, and its length is
                        calculated based on an element’s font size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         A single em unit is equivalent to an element’s font size. So, for example, if an element has a font size of 14 pixels and
                        a width set to 5em, the width would equal 70 pixels (14 pixels multiplied by 5).
