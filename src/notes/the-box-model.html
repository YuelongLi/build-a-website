        <h1>Opening the box model</h1>
        <p>
             We've familiarized ourselves with HTML and CSS; we know what they look like and how to accomplish some of the basics. now
            we're going to go a bit deeper and llok at exactly how elements are displayed on a page and how they are sized.
        </p>
        <div>
            <h2>How are elements displayed?</h2>
             Before jumping into the box model, it helps to understand how elements are displayed. In Lesson 2 we covered the difference
            between block-level and inline-level elements. To quickly recap, block-level elements occupy any available width, regardless
            of their content, and begin on a new line. Inline-level elements occupy only the width their content requires and line up
            on the same line, one after the other. Block-level elements are generally used for larger pieces of content, such as headings
            and structural elements. Inline-level elements are generally used for smaller pieces of content, such as a few words selected
            to be bold or italicized.
            <div>
                <h3>Display</h3>
                How elements are dispalyed - as inline or block-level elements - is determined by the display property. Every element come
                with a default display property value; however, as with all other property values, the value may be overwritten with the 
                "display:" property with values such as "block, inline, inline-block, and none"
                <div class="notebox" id="demo1">
                    <style>
                        /**
                            We can change an element’s display property value by selecting that element within CSS and declaring a new display 
                            property value. A value of block will make that element a block-level element.
                        **/                    
                        #demo1 p {
                            display: block;
                        }
                    
                        /**A value of inline will make that element an inlin-level element.**/                    
                        #demo1 p {
                            display: inline;
                        }
                    
                        /**
                            Things get interesting with the inline-block value. Using this value will allow an element to behave as a block-level 
                            element, accepting all box model properties (which we’ll cover soon). However, the element will be displayed in line 
                            with other elements, and it will not begin on a new line by default.
                        **/                   
                        #demo1 p {
                            display: inline-block;
                        }
                    </style>
                    <p>Paragraph one</p>
                    <p>Paragraph two</p>
                    <p>Paragraph three</p>
                </div>
                 <p>
                    Lastly, using a value of none will completely hide an element and render the page as if that element doesn’t exist. Any
                    elements nested within this element will also be hidden.

            <h2>Working with the Box Model</h2>
            <p>
                Every element is a rectangular box, and there are several properties that determine the size of that box. The core of the box
                is defined by the width and height o an element, which may be determined by the display property, by the contents of the element,
                which may be determined by the display property, by the contents of the element, or by specified <span class="p">width</span> and 
                <span class="p">height</span> properties. <span class="p">padding</span> and then <span class="p">border</span> expand the dimensions
                of the box outward from the element's width and height. Lastly, any margin we have specified will follow the border. 
            </p>

            let's look at the following code:
            <div class="notebox">
                 div { 
                    <p class="indent">
                         border: 6px solid #949599;
                        <br>height: 100px;
                        <br>margin: 20px;
                        <br>padding: 20px;
                        <br>width: 400px;
                    </p>
                }
            </div>
             According to the box model, the total width of an element can be calculated using the following formula:
             <div class="notebox">
                 margin-right + border-right + padding-right + width + padding-left + border-left + margin-left
             </div>
             The same concepts applies similarly to the height.
             <br>
             <br>
             <div class="notebox">
                 <h3>Margin &amp; Padding on Inline-Level Elements</h3>
                 <p>
                    Inline-level elements are affected a bit differently than block and inline-block elements when it comes to margins and padding.
                    Margins only work horizontally—left and right—on inline-level elements. Padding works on all four sides of inline-level elements;
                    however, the vertical padding—the top and bottom—may bleed into the lines above and below an element.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Margins and padding work like normal for block and inline-block elements.
                 </p>
             </div>
             <div>
                 <h3>Borders</h3>
                 <p>
                     Borders fall between the padding and margin, providing an outline around an element. The border property requires three
                    values: <span class="p">width</span>, <span class="p">style</span>, and <span class="p">color</span>. Shorthand values 
                    for the border property are stated in that order—<span class="p">width</span>,
                    <span class="p">style</span>,
                    <span class="p">color</span>. In
                    longhand, these three values can be broken up into the border-width, border-style, and border-color properties. These longhand
                    properties are useful for changing, or overwriting, a single border value.
                 </p>
             </div>
             <div>
                 <h3>Box Sizing</h3>
                 Until now the box model has been an additive design. We always need to add the width, padding and border property values together to
                 get the actual, full width of an element. 
                 
                 The box model may, however, be changed to support different calculations. CSS3 introduced the box-sizing propety, which allows us to 
                 change exactly how the box model works and hwo an element's size is caluated. The property accepts three primary values --- <span class="p">content-box</span>,
                 <span class="p">padding-box</span>, and <span class="p">border-box</span> --- each of which has a slightly different impact on how the box size is calculated. 
             </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Content Box</h3>
                <p>
                    The <span class="p">content-box</span> value is the default value, leaving the box model as an additive design. If we don't use the <span class="p">box-sizing</span>
                    property, this will be the default value for all elements. The size of an element begins with the <span class="p">width</span> and <span class="p">height</span> properties,
                    and then any padding, border or margin property are added on from there.
                </p>
                <div class="notebox">
                    <h3>Broser-Specific Properties and Values</h3>
                    <p>
                         Vendor prefixes may be seen on both properties and values, all depending on the CSS specification. Here they are shown on
                        the box-sizing property. Browser vendors were free to chose when to use a prefix and when not to. Thus, some properties and
                        values require vendor prefixes for certain browser vendors but not for others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Moving forward, when a property or value needs a vendor prefix, the prefix will only be used in the introduction of that
                        property or value (in the interest of keeping our code digestible and concise). Do not forget to add the necessary vendor
                        prefixes when you’re actually writing the code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For reference, the most common vendor prefixes are outlined here:
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        Moxilla Firefox: <span class="p">-moz-</span>
                        <br>Microsoft Internet Explorer: <span class="p">-ms-</span>
                        <br>Webkit (Google Chrome and Apple Safari): <span class="p">-webkit-</span>
                    </p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Border Box</h3>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the <span class="p">border-box</span> value alters the box model so that any <span class="p">border</span>
                </p>
            </div>
