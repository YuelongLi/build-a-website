        <h2 id="introduction">Semantics</h2>
        So what exactly are semantics? Semantics within html is the practice of giving content on the page meaning and structure
        by using the proper element. Semantic code describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance
        of that content. Several benefits of using semanticc elements include enabling computers, screen readers, search
        engines, and other devices to adequately read and understand the content on a web page.
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Division And Spans</h2>
        <!--Divisions, or <div>s, and <span>s are HTML elements that act as containers solely for 
                    styling purposes. As generic containers, they do not come with any overarching meaning
                    or semantic value. Paragraphs are semantic in that content wrapped within a <p> element 
                    is known and understood as a paragraph. <div>s and <span>s do not hold any such meaning 
                    and are simply containers.-->
        A division is a block-level element that is commonly used to identify large groupings of content, and which helps to build
        a wb page's layout and design. A
        <span>span</span>, on the other hand, is an inline-level elements may be nested inside one another; however, they cannot
        wrap block-level elements. We'll usually see inline-level elements with smaller pieces of a content, such as a few
        words.
        <!--

                </span>
            -->
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Text-Based Elements </h2>
        Many different forms of media and content exist online; however, text is predominant. Accordingly, there are a number of
        different elemetns ofr displaying text on a web page. For now we'll focus on the more popular elements, including
        headings, paragraphs, bold to show importance, and italics for emphasis.

        <h3 style="color:#2db34a">Headings</h3>

        <p>
            Headings are block-level elements, and they come in six different rankings, (h1) through (h6). Headings help to quickly break
            up content and establish hierachy, and they are key identifiers for users reading a page. They also help search
            enines to index and determine the content on a page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each heading level should be used where it is semantically valued, and should not be used to make text bold or big—there
            are other, better ways to do that.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color:#2db34a">Paragraphs</h3>
        <p>
            Headings are often followed by supporting paragraphs. Paragraphs are defined using the (p) block-level element. Paragraphs
            can appear one after the other, adding information to a page as desired.
        </p>

        <h3>Bold Text With Strong</h3>
        <p>
            The (strong) element is semantically used to give strong importance to text, and is thus the most popular option for
            <strong>bolding</strong> text. The (b) element, on the other hand, semantically means to stylistically offset text, which
            isn’t always the best choice for text deserving prominent attention. We have to gauge the significance of the
            text we wish to set as bold and to choose an element accordingly.
        </p>

        <h3>Italicize Text with Emphasis</h3>
        <p>
            The (em) element is used semantically to place a stressed
            <em>emphasis</em> on text; it is thus the most popular option for italicizing text. The other option, the (i) element,
            is used semantically to convey text in an
            <i>alternative</i> voice or tone, almost as if it were placed in quotation marks. Again, we will need to gauge the
            significance of the text we want to italicize and choose an element accordingly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Building Structure</h2>
        <img src="https://learn.shayhowe.com/assets/images/courses/html-css/getting-to-know-html/building-structure.png" alt="structure demonstration"
            style="width:50%">
        <p>
            The &lt;header&gt; element, like it sounds, is used to identify the top of a page, article, section, or other segment of
            a page. In general, the &lt;header&gt; element may include a heading, introductory text, and even naviation.
        </p>

        <div class="notebox">
            <h4>&lt;header&gt; vs. &lt;head&gt; vs. &lt;h1~6&gt;</h4>
            <p>
                It is easy to confuse the (header) element with the (head) element or the heading elements, (h1) through (h6). They all have
                different semantic meanings and should be used according to their meanings. For reference:
            </p>

            <p>
                The (header) element is a structural element that outlines the heading of a segment of a page. It falls within the (body)
                element. The (head) element is not displayed on a page and is used to outline metadata, including the document
                title, and links to external files. It falls directly within the (html) element.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                The (nav) element identifies a section of major navigational links on a page. The (nav) element should be reserved for primary
                navgation sections only, such as global navigation, a table of content, previous/next links, or other noteworthy
                of navigational links.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most commonly, links included wihtin the (nav) element will link to other pages within the same website or to parts of the
                same web page. Miscelllaneous one-off links should not be wrapped within the (nav) element; they should use
                the anchor element, (a), and the anchor element alone.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Article
            </h3>

            <p>
                The (article) element is used to identify a section of independent, self-contained content that may be independently distributed
                or reused. We’ll often use the (article) element to mark up blog posts, newspaper articles, user-submitted
                content, and the like.
            </p>

            <p>
                When deciding whether to use the (article) element, we must determine if the content within the element could be replicated
                elsewhere without any confusion. If the content within the (article) element were removed from the context
                of the page and placed, for example, within an email or printed work, that content should still make sense.
            </p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h3>Section</h3>
            The section element is used to indentify a thematic grouping of content, which gnerally, but not always, includes a heading.
            The grouping grouping of content within the section element may be generic in nature, but it's useful to identify
            all of the content as related
            <br/> The section element is commonly used to break up and provide hierachy to a page.
        </section>

        <div>
            <h3>Aside</h3>
            <aside>
                The (aside) elements holds content, such as sidebars, inserts or brief explanations, that is tangetially related to the content
                surrounding it. When used within an (article) element, for example, the (aside) element may identify content
                related to the author of the article.
            </aside>
            <br>
            <p>
                We may instinctively think of an (aside) element as an element that ppears off to the left or right side of a page. However
                an (aside) elements actually appears on a new line just as every bock-level does, so if we want to change
                the positioning of the element to side, we would need to position with css style.
            </p>
        </div>

        <footer>
            <h3>Footer</h3>
            The (footer) element identifies the closing or end of a page, article, section, or other setment of a page. Genrally the
            (footer) element is found at the bottom of its parent. Content within the (footer) element should be relative
            information and should not diverge from the document or section it is included within.
        </footer>
    </div>

        <h2>Creating Hyperlinks</h2>
        <p>
            Along with text, one of the core components of the Internet is the hyperlink, which provides the ability to link from one
            web page or resource to another. Hyperlinks are established using the anchor, &lt;a&gt;, inline-level element.
            In order to create a link from one page (or resource) to another, the href attribute, known as a hyperlink reference,
            is required. The href attribute value identifies the destination of the link.
        </p>

        <div class="notebox">
            <h3>
                Wrapping Block-Level Elements with Anchors
            </h3>
            By nature of the anchor element, (a), is an inline element, and according to web standards, inline-level elements may not
            wrapt block-level elements. With the introduction of HTML5, however, anchor elements specifically have permission
            to wrap either block, inline or any tlevel elements. This is a break from the standard convention, but it's permissbible
            inorder to enable entire blocks of content on a page to become links.
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Relative &amp; Absolute Paths</h3>

            The two most common types of links are links to other pages of the same website and links to other websites. These links
            are identified by their href attribute values, also known as their paths.
            <br> Links pointing to other pages of the same website will have a relative path, which does not include the domain
            (.com, .org, .edu, etc.) in the href attribute value. Because the link is pointing to another page on the same
            website, the href attribute value needs to include only the filename of the page being linked to: about.html,
            for example.
            <br> Should the page being linked to reside within a different directory, or folder, the href attribute value needs
            to reflect this as well. Say the about.html page resides within the
            <span style="color:cornflowerblue">pages</span> directory; the relative path would then be
            <span style="color:cornflowerblue">pages</span>/about.html.
            <br> Linking to other websites outside of the current one requires an absolute path, where the href attribute value
            must include the full domain. A link to Google would need the href attribute value of http://google.com, starting
            with http and including the domain, .com in this case. Linking to local files requires an absolute path, where
            the href attribute contain the local url of the file.

        <div>
            <h3>Linkding to an Email Address</h3>
            Occasionally we may want to create a hyperlink to our email address—for example, hyperlink text that says “Email Me,” which
            when clicked opens a user’s default email client and pre-populates part of an email. At a minimum the email address
            to which the email is being sent is populated; other information such as a subject line and body text may also
            be included.
            <br> To create an
            <a href="mailto:yuelong.edu@gmail.com">email link</a>, the href attribute value needs to start with mailto: followed by the email address to which the
            email should be sent. To create an email link to yuelong.edu@gmail.com, for example, the href attribute value
            would be mailto: yuelong.edu@gmail.com. Additionally, subject, body text, and other information for the email
            may be populated. To add a subject line, we’ll include the subject= parameter after the email address. The first
            parameter following the email address must begin with a question mark, ?, to bind it to the hyperlink path. Multiple
            words within a subject line require that spaces be encoded using %20.
            <br> Adding body text works in the same way as adding the subject, this time using the body= parameter in the href
            attribute value. Because we are binding one parameter to another we need to use the ampersand, &amp;, to separate
            the two. As with the subject, spaces must be encoded using %20, and line breaks must be encoded using %0A.

            <div class="notebox">

            <h3>Opening links in a new window</h3>
            One feature availble with hyperlinks is the ability to deterine where a link opens when clicked. Without any specification,
            links open in the same window from which they are clikced, however, links may also be opened in new windows.
            To trigger the action of opening a link in a new window, use the target attribute with a value of _blank. The
            target attribute determines exactly where the link will be displayed, and the _blank value specifies a new window.

            <h3>Linking to parts of the same page</h3>
            Periodically we'll see hyperlinks that link to part of the same page the link appears on. A common exaple of these same-page
            links are "Back to top" links that return a user to the top of a page.
            <p>
                We can create an on-page link by first setting an id attribute on the element we wish to link to, then using the value of
                that id attribute within an anchor element’s href attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the “Back to top” link as an example, we can place an id attribute value on the taget element, and create an anchor
                element with an href attribute value of #top, pound sign and all, to link to the target element.
